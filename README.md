## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at Sorbonne UniversitÃ© in Paris. I'm looking for an apprenticeship in Web Development preferably in an enterprise with a strong cybersecurity focus!

I know some frameworks like Spring and RoR and I'm currently learning cybersecurity so I can continue my education with a master degree in cybersecurity next year.
